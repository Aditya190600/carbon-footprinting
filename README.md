# What Is Our Carbon Footprint?

Carbon Emissions exist everywhere. From our every breath to flights flying in the sky, all living objects emit Carbon in one form or another.
Since the late 1990s, the term carbon footprint has become widely used in the public debate on personal and corporate responsibility in response to global climate change. Its ubiquity is largely because it appears to be an easy way of commodifying an individual or company's CO2 emissions.

But despite its frequent popular use, there is no clear scientific definition of the term, and there remains confusion as to what it actually means and measures. Definitions range from direct CO2 emissions to full life-cycle greenhouse-gas emissions.
Carbon footprinting aims to create an educational website to create awareness about impact of greenhouse gases, significance of carbon footprint and why we should care about it.
We are also attempting to use machine learning to create a better understanding of footprints of humans on Earth and its surrounding ecosystem.
The datasets provide us with the values of the atmospheric gases which help us to calculate the greenhouse gases which ultimately help us to infer how clean our air is and how urgently we need to take actions.

We plan to predict the pollution levels of a specific city which helps in bringing awareness to people about the kind of situation they are in. There by motivates them to take action against the rapid increase in greenhouse gas emissions
