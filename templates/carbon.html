    <h2>WHAT IS CARBON FOOTPRINT ?</h2>
    <p>
      A carbon footprint is the total amount of greenhouse gases (including carbon dioxide and methane) that are generated by our actions.Carbon footprint, amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions associated with all the activities of a person or other entity (e.g., building, corporation, country, etc.). It includes direct emissions, such as those that result from fossil-fuel combustion in manufacturing, heating, and transportation, as well as emissions required to produce the electricity associated with goods and services consumed. Globally, the average is closer to 4 tons. To have the best chance of avoiding a 2℃ rise in global temperatures, the average global carbon footprint per year needs to drop under 2 tons by 2050.</p>
    <p>Lowering individual carbon footprints from 16 tons to 2 tons doesn’t happen overnight! By making small changes to our actions, like eating less meat, taking less connecting flights and line drying our clothes, we can start making a big difference.</p>

      <h2>SIGNIFICANCE</h2>

<p>Scientists attribute the global warming trend observed since the mid-20th century to the human expansion of the "greenhouse effect"— warming that results when the atmosphere traps heat radiating from Earth toward space.
Gases that contribute to the greenhouse effect include:<br>
<br><b>Water vapor</b><br>Water vapor increases as the Earth's atmosphere warms, but so does the possibility of clouds and precipitation, making these some of the most important feedback mechanisms to the greenhouse effect.
<br><b>Carbon dioxide </b><br>Carbon dioxide is released through natural processes such as respiration and volcano eruptions and through human activities such as deforestation, land use changes, and burning fossil fuels. Humans have increased atmospheric CO2 concentration by 47% since the Industrial Revolution began. This is the most important long-lived "forcing" of climate change.
<br><b>Methane </b><br> On a molecule-for-molecule basis, methane is a far more active greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide, but also one which is much less abundant in the atmosphere.
<br><b>Nitrous oxide</b><br> A powerful greenhouse gas produced by soil cultivation practices, especially the use of commercial and organic fertilizers, fossil fuel combustion, nitric acid production, and biomass burning.
<img id="greenhouseimg2"src="https://climate.nasa.gov/system/internal_resources/details/original/249_Causes-greenhouse-gas-molecules-cropped-more-55.jpg" alt="Artic methane emissions">
<br><b>Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)</b><br> Synthetic compounds entirely of industrial origin used in a number of applications, but now largely regulated in production and release to the atmosphere by international agreement for their ability to contribute to destruction of the ozone layer. They are also greenhouse gases.</p>

<p>
	On Earth, human activities are changing the natural greenhouse. Over the last century the burning of fossil fuels like coal and oil has increased the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2).
The consequences of changing the natural atmospheric greenhouse are difficult to predict, but some effects seem likely:<br>
<ul>
<li>On average, Earth will become warmer.</li>
<li>Warmer conditions will  probably lead to individual regions becoming wetter and others dryer.</li>
<li>A stronger greenhouse effect will warm the ocean and partially melt glaciers and ice sheets, increasing sea level.</li></ul></p>
      <!--<p><b>Depletion of Resources</b><br>
Large carbon footprints deplete resources on large and small scales, from a country’s deforestation activities to one home’s increased use of air conditioning. The more those with large carbon footprints use resources, the more greenhouse gases increase and spur further climate change.</p>
      <p><b>Climate Change and Recycling</b><br>
Although reducing energy use is today’s latest rage, a measure of your carbon footprint will also include recycling. According to Carbon Footprint, a carbon management business, when you don’t recycle, you waste the energy that is used making and transporting new items. Recycling and reusing allows less energy to go into the process of creating new items. This means fewer fossil fuels are being used. In addition, Carbon Footprint points out that when you recycle, your garbage takes up less room in landfills. Thus, by not recycling, you increase your greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to climate change.</p>-->

  <h2>MEASURES WHICH WE CAN FOLLOW</h2><p>
  <b> Unplug Your Devices</b><br>
Anytime a cord is plugged into a socket, it’s drawing energy – so although your device isn’t charging, you’re still contributing to your carbon footprint. Simple solution? Leave your electronics unplugged at all times, unless you’re actually using them.</p>
  <p><b>Drive Less</b><br>
Choose to walk, bike, or take the bus – leave the car at home, and you’ll be making an easy decision with immediate results.</p>

  <p><b>Fly less</b><br>
Research from The Guardian has found that one long-haul flight can produce more carbon emissions than the average citizen produces in a year in a number of countries.
  </p>
  <p><b>Go vegan (or at least flexitarian)</b><br>
What would happen if the whole world went vegan? A study from Oxford University estimated there would be a 49 per cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from food production
it’s generally agreed that you could cut your carbon footprint by around 20 per cent by switching to a vegan diet.</p>

  <p><b>Optimise your home</b><br>
Individuals and corporations can reduce their respective carbon footprints by installing energy-efficient lighting, adding insulation in buildings, or using renewable energy sources to generate the electricity they require. </p>
  <p><b>
    Buy secondhand clothes</b><br>
Fast fashion is hugely harmful to the planet. Aside from the production process itself – which expels 1.2bn tonnes of CO2 a year (more than the aviation and shipping industries combined) – the wear-once-then-toss attitude permeating high street fashion means that racks of flimsy clothes are quickly transformed into one million tonnes of waste a year, much of will be incinerated or added to landfill.</p>
